Hi there! Welcome and thanks for checking out my blog! I started this
blog as a way to start writing about my life as a Catholic in the modern age
(it's not as easy as I thought it would be as a child, but it wasn't supposed to
be!). 

So, who am I?! Well, I'm a Catholic husband (and soon to be father of twins as
of this blog's creation) living in the modern age. Relevant to this blog, I also
work in tech as a software developer. I wanted to find a simple way to combine
my faith and my career and concluded writing about my experiences on a
self-created and self-hosted blog would be a good start down that journey.

My journey as a Catholic began with my Baptism at 3 months old but only recently
truly took off. I attended Catholic schools through high school, received my
sacraments, and tried my best to remain faithful during college (well, I thought
I was, but now I know I wasn't). Marriage and a couple tragic events really
kicked into gear my reception of God's call and His grace and I finally began to
really understand what it truly meant to _be_ Catholic and a follower of Christ.

I know that I am a person of action. I have to be doing something with my hands
to continue to grow in any journey I embark on. I know there are many things I
could do, but writing about my experience, sharing it, and putting my thoughts
to words on the Internet seemed like a good start to putting my faith into
action. My current plan is to write one post every two weeks. I'll try to focus
on things I'm currently thinking about as well as how our Catholic faith relates
to the modern world of cell phones, Internet, and, still sadly, sin. My first
hidden realization about the modern world is that it is still the same broken
world humans have inhabited for centuries, but everything is heightened, more
intense, and finds a way to enter a sacred setting in your life: your home.
To combat this, we can *still* rely on the centuries of teachings from Catholics 
that have come before us to navigate a broken world; the difference is how the
Church promulgate these teachings and relate them to our modern world to truly
reach the young generations of Catholics.

Well, I hope you enjoy the blog! Feel free to contact me at [moderncatholic@proton.me](mailto:moderncatholic@proton.me)

## Building the Site
Currently, the site is hosted on Github Pages using Jekyll (written in the Ruby
programming) and takes my Markdown (enhanced text) files of my posts and
transforms them into a format that your web browser can display to you. 

Eventually, I plan to make this site completely written by myself (in my
favorite programming language, Rust). I wanted to get off the ground running
quickly and I am bad at the actual presentation and design of websites, so this
approach was a good first step.
